## Overview
TOAMI is an open-source browser extension tool designed to help phishing hunters detect phishing sites in real-time. This tool not only detects brand abuse from phishing site content but also performs detailed analysis using Indicator of Kit (IoK) to identify malicious sites that use phishing kits. TOAMI is designed to allow anyone to easily investigate phishing sites, and it is provided as a browser extension.

## Features

* **Real-time phishing detection:** TOAMI checks website content and common phishing patterns in real time when users visit the site.
* **HTML Keyword Analysis for Brand Identification:** The tool analyzes the HTML content of phishing sites to identify the brand names of target companies and detect phishing sites that impersonate legitimate companies.
* **Favicon Hash-Based Brand Identification:** TOAMI analyzes the hash value of favicons to detect fake brands. This allows you to quickly identify phishing sites even if they have been rebranded.

* **Phishing Kit Analysis (IoK-based):** TOAMI uses Indicator of Kit (IoK) to perform advanced analysis to identify common tools and techniques used by phishing actors. This allows you to track multiple phishing sites using the same kit.

* **Automatic Log Collection and Screenshot Capture:** When you visit a phishing site, TOAMI automatically captures screenshots and logs of the investigation. These are stored locally for later analysis.

* (Additional features if available)
